Python macro to win every champion-game in https://www.sketchleague.com .

!!!!!!!FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY !!!!!!!!!

This program will abuse the possibility to spam commands and win the game by printing the name of every single character into
the chatbox immediately. 

This was written in a few minutes to build a poc. (quick and dirty code and I think I missspelled some names :( )

Usage:

1. Start it with Python and use help to display every possible command.
2. Position your mouse on the chatbox and type setpos in console. //// Or get the coordinates and input them with setpos manually!
3. Move the cursor and check with testcursor if it will go back to the desired position. (if so you can put the cursor wherever you want)
4. Type normal / random into the console and win.
5. Annoy your friends. :-)

Utilizes https://pywinauto.github.io/ to interact with mouse and send keyboard events.
